# DigitalClockProject
Digital Clock Circuit Design
This project is a digital clock circuit created using Proteus software, demonstrating various combinational and sequential logic components. The design incorporates the following components:

7SEG-BCD: Converts BCD inputs to control 7-segment displays for digit representation.
555 Timer: Acts as a clock pulse generator, providing consistent time intervals.
7476 (JK Flip-Flop): Used to build counters and store states.
AND Gate: Employed for logical operations and enabling conditions.
Battery: Powers the entire circuit.
Capacitor: Handles timing and reduces noise within the circuit.
NOR Gate: Logic gate for combining and controlling digital signals.
NOT Gate: Inverts logic signals as required.
Resistor (RES): Limits current flow to protect components.
Switch: Provides manual reset or start control for the clock.
IC 4073 & IC 7476: Used for additional logic operations and state management.
The project simulates a fully functional digital clock with hour, minute, and second counters. The circuit design illustrates the application of basic digital electronics concepts and is ideal for learning about counters, pulse generation, and display control.
